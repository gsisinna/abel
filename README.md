The code in this repository was used to make the first human-like movements for this ultra-realistic humanoid robot, in the context of my master's thesis for the MSc in Bionics Engineering (Biorobotics).

Each directory is a ROS package and you need to install dependencies for dynamixel motor management: [see here](http://wiki.ros.org/dynamixel_workbench).
